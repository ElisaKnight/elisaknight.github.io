            <p>We were founded in 2022 by two men and our names are Troy and Joey. We are family men at heart and believe every family deserves to have fresh and clean meat and other farm products available to them at a good cost. We like to participate in our local community too by attending local farmers markets and other opportunities to help out and be a part of our ever-growing comminuty.</p>
